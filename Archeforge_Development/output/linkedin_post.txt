Most people spend hours on repetitive tasks that AI could handle in seconds.

Here's the truth: You don't need to be a developer to automate your work.

I just discovered how simple it is to build a 3-step automation using Zapier and ChatGPT that runs 24/7 — no coding required.

Here's the basic framework:

• Choose a TRIGGER (the event that starts your automation — like dropping a file into a folder)
• Add an ACTION using ChatGPT (have it generate content, analyze data, write copy, etc.)
• Save the OUTPUT automatically (to Dropbox, Google Drive, email, or 5,000+ other apps)

The example that opened my eyes: I drop an email draft into a folder, and within 2 minutes, AI generates 5 subject line options and saves them to a new file.

One-time setup. Works forever.

The real power? Once you understand triggers and actions, you can build hundreds of different automations using the same logic.

This changes everything we've learned about AI — because now it works for you even when you're not at your desk.

What repetitive task would you automate first if you had a system like this running 24/7?
